[%b Tedre2008 %] describes three views of computing:

-   The *mathematical tradition*
    considers programs to be implementations of algorithms
    which are correct or incorrect as well as more or less efficient.
    Its main aim is to create coherent theoretical structures and systems.

-   The *engineering tradition*
    thinks of programs as processes that can affect the world,
    which are more or less effective and reliable.
    Its goal is to build things that work.

-   The *scientific tradition*
    views programs as more or less accurate models of natural or artificial processes,
    and sees them as a way to deepen our understanding of other things.

The starting point of this book is that there is a fourth option:
a *humanist tradition*
that focuses on who gets to decide how computing is used
and on how what we build and how we build it are shaped by the ways we think.
